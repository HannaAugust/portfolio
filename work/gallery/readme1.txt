For this week I heavily cleaned code and figured out cleaner way to achive the same functions.
---learning three.js framework: I discovered a great feature called CSS3DRenderer. It helps to deal with shaders and textures a lot and makes it easier to connect them with DOMelement. Nevertheless, I figured that without base knowledge of working with shaders, this fiture will be impossible to use. So I had to figure out the function of every single Line in examples.
In addition, this feature is responsive to mobile, so my gallery works on my phone easily.

I added a couple matrices and also included transition between of them
As well I made this gallery interactive, so now the user can spin, zoom in/zoom out, and change layout of pictures.

I am continuing working on displaying large picture on click, but I got some troubles with grid and indicies for now.
