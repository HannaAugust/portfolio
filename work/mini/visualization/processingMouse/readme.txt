I would like to continue working on this for my midterm project, adding some features such as:
-time intervals for growing tree.
-changing colors with time and by draging slider.
-on hover over some parts of pictures open a comments
-interaction part:"grow" some new parts of tree on click.

But even clock is difficult to figure.
Also still have to figure out how to set interval between drawing pathes and make them apear one after each other.


Beside that, I was very concerned about graphics: I drew just strokes in illustrator. but it apears as objects. How should I prepare an svg file for work with that?
