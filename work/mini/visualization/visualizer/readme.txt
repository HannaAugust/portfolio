Since I am done with my final project (gallery), I decided to explore another functionality and examples, so for this week I started to create music visualizer. For first steps i watched some totorials and explored code from different webGl visualizers and also found useful THREE.js features for working with audio files ( audioContent, analyser, audioBuffer and etc.).
I have some issues that I am going to fix in following work on this project:
 -creating array for dropped music files and list through the list.
 -add controlls for changing parametrs of graphics
 -resizing of page
 -figure out width of lines (????)
